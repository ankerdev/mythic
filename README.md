# ts-express-graphql
A boilerplate that allows you to spin up a GraphQL API in no time. üöÄ

Out of the box, it comes with swell features such as:
- Models and ORM using objection.js [https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/], with added soft delete, `withTrashed()` and restore functionality
  - The typings for the soft deleting functions are currently missing, as I would need to fork objection.js.
  - You can still run these functions by doing `await (<any>User).query().withTrashed()...` (yeah, I know, it's not great...)
  - Look at `./src/lib/objection/` to explore this funcitonality
- Database migrations and seeds utilizing knex [https://knexjs.org/]
- Apollo Server (GraphQL Implementation) [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/]
- A basic User model with GraphQL type definitions and resolvers, automatic password hashing on insert/update and login functionality
- JWT authentication and middleware
- Authorization policies

## Todo
If you like contributing to things and see something you can improve--feel free to fork the repo and PR your feature(s). üèÖ

- Allow for more databases in config, e.g. SQLite3 and PostgreSQL (NB. needs to be supported by objection.js and knex)
- Switch to TypeORM if it's any better? [https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm]
- Other cool stuff to make it a better experience üòé

## How do I use this?
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your environment variables
3. Start the server in development by running `npm start`

## How do I make migrations?
- As our `knexfile` is in TypeScript we need to add `--knexfile knexfile.ts` to *all* the knex commands
- You can run `knex` command from `./node_modules/.bin/knex` or install knex globally (`npm i -g knex`) to run it without the node_modules path
  - e.g. to make a migration `products_table` as a `.ts` file we run `knex migrate:make products_table --knexfile knexfile.ts -x ts` where `-x ts` defines our TypeScript extension.
- Running migrations: `knex migrate:latest`
- Rolling back migrations: `knex migrate:rollback`
